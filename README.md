# Agile Poker

This tool was originally forked from [mkartchner994/agile-poker](https://github.com/mkartchner994/agile-poker).  I was asked by a friend to try to help modify the code for her needs.  While she found the solution first, this was my first introduction to an Agile concept.  I found the concept interesting and have decided to re-envision the application as a study opportunity and portfolio piece.

###Status

Currently most of the design I plan to do is finished.  There are three (3) possible changes I am currently considering:
1. Creating separate container items for row 1 vs. row 2 so as to reduce empty space.
1. Replacing the table in the PointBoard item with a container in which the buttons 'flow' as the window re-sizes.
1. Modifying the TableFill module so that the number of columns in the table is driven by the number needed instead of a fixed 2 columns.

There will not be much change in layout or usage of React animation for a little while.  While studying PHP and the Laravel framework at [Laracasts.com](https://laracasts.com/), I was introduced to TDD.  Before proceeding with work on this project, I want to learn how to incorporate TDD into JavaScript and React.

### Demo

You can view a demo of this tool here (_to be determined_).  Design is not my forte, but the CSS is functional.

Since this is still a work in process, once the site is set up, it will be updated as I complete more work.

### Setup
The original README from the forked repository is contained in the wiki.  It contains the current installation instructions.
