# Agile Poker

This tool was originally forked from https://github.com/mkartchner994/agile-poker.  I was asked by a friend to try to help modify the code for her needs.  While she found the solution first, this was my first introduction to an Agile concept.  I found the concept interesting and have decided to re-envision the application as a study opportunity and portfolio piece.
### Demo

You can view a demo of this tool here (_to be determined_).  Design is not my forte, but the CSS is functional.

Since this is still a work in process, once the site is set up, it will be updated as I complete more work.

### Setup
The original README from the forked repository is contained in the wiki.  It contains the current installation instructions.
